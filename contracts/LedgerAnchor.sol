 * @title  LedgerAnchor
 * @notice Daily Merkle checkpoint of LineLock pick hashes on Injective EVM.
 *
 * Receipts prove WHEN each pick existed (x402 payment block time < kickoff).
 * This contract proves the LEDGER DATABASE was never rewritten after the fact:
 * a nightly job Merkle-izes the day's `pick_hash`es and posts the root here,
 * write-once per day. `linelock-audit --all` recomputes each day's root from
 * the served ledger and diffs it against `AnchorPosted` — any post-hoc edit to
 * a settled row changes the root and is detectable by anyone.
 *
 * Proof verification is performed off-chain against the posted root (the tree
 * uses sha256 over the hex pick hashes — see engine/merkle.ts). The chain only
 * needs to hold the immutable commitment.
